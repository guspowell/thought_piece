		<div class="col-md-12 introduction">And it’s not surprising really. We’re at a very interesting point in history right now. It’s so interesting and dramatic that we may only be able to appreciate its importance ten or 20 years from now. For perhaps only the third time in 600 years, what we can do technologically is stretching miles ahead of our ability to imagine what to do with it. This is having a profound effect on how things change, and the rate at which they do. Effectively, the future proceeds at the rate at which we can assimilate it.</div>


		<div class="col-md-12 sub-header-text">SLOW-MO EXPLOSIONS</div>
		<div class="col-md-12 paragraph">
			In many cases we no longer have to say, ‘If only we had the technology to do this,’ because we already do. We have to say, ‘What is the real need here? And, of a thousand ways of achieving it, which shall we choose?’<br><br>
			Think of this as a slow-mo explosion. Bits fly out in all directions, and keeping track of all the bits gets harder and harder the further they diverge. So it becomes harder and harder to put individual streams of thought
			together, and to lace the individual solutions and knowledge together to exploit the New.

		My dad was an electronics engineer during the second World War and his specialisation was radio.
		He told me once that he went into the conflict believing that he knew pretty much all there was to know about radio: the maths, the science, the theory, and much of the practice. However, when he came back in 1945 the science had expanded so

		dramatically that he felt he only knew about a tenth of what he needed to know. He went further by suggesting that NOBODY knew all of it any more. Now, that wouldn’t necessarily impact on his imagination of what might be possible, but it certainly held him back when he needed to know how to do it. He often claimed that his biggest single contribution to the development of practical electronics
		was his sand-excluding technology for electrical relays...stretching a condom over them.<br><br>
		In that solution, we have an interesting analogue to our present condition. It’s the same analogue that allowed the ground station staff during the Apollo 13 mission to work out how to make a carbon dioxide scrubber out of the
		bits they had on board the stricken spacecraft. The term ‘necessity is the mother of invention’ has never been so appropriate as it is now. Stretch our imagination and it’s suddenly amazing what we can actually do, sometimes with quite modest technological means.

			"initial": "Thanks for trying out Punch! This <b>quick hands-on tutorial</b> will help you to get familiar with the basics of Punch (It won't take more than 15 minutes).\b[Let's Start!](#show_help)",

			"step1": "We believe the separation of content from its presentation is important for any kind of site. To make this easy, Punch creates two directories named `contents` and `templates`. All information you wish to communicate should go in `contents`; all presentational elements (layouts, assets) should be placed in `templates`.\bIf you go inside the `templates` directory, you will find a file named `_layout.mustache`. This is the main layout of your site. You can create different layouts for different sections of your site. For now, we shall use the main layout to render all pages.\bOpen the `_layout.mustache` and place the tag `{{{intro}}}` inside `&lt;div role=\"main\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;`.\bReload this page when you're done.",

			"step2": "Did you notice that the `intro` tag you just placed, got replaced with some placeholder text? Let's try to figure out how it happened.\bWhen Punch serves a request, it looks for the best matching content and layout to render the requested page. In this case, we requested for the `/index.html` page. So, Punch chose `contents/index.json` as the best matching content and the main layout to render the page.\bIf you look in `contents/index.json`, you will find the `intro` property defined. You can change its value and see the effect.\bReload this page after changing the value of `intro`.",

			"step3": "Nice! You should now see the value you just defined got rendered on the page. [JSON](http://json.org) is a good way to define short, structured content. But what about long, formatted texts we often want to insert into our pages? It would be cumbersome if we had to write HTML tags inside JSON strings. Well, there's a smarter option - [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).\bLet's try to define the intro text using Markdown. For that, we need to create a directory named `_index` under `contents`. Then inside it, create a file named `intro.markdown`. Write the intro in that file, using Markdown. Make sure you break the text into multiple paragraphs, emphasize points and add links.\bReload the page again, to see how updated intro will render.",

			"step4": "You're picking up so fast! Notice how you can provide content for a page, in a JSON file named by the page name(`index.json`) and/or a directory named by the page name preceded with an underscore(`_index`), placed inside `contents`.\bSuch a directory, is known as extended contents, can contain parsable content such as Markdown files or even JSON files. Those content can be accessed in layouts by the name of the file (eg. `intro.markdown` is accessed as `intro`).\bFollowing these concepts, let's add a About page to the site. Create a directory named `_about` in `contents` and place a `intro.markdown` file for the About page as well.\bOnce done, visit [http://" + location.hostname + ":" + location.port + "/about](/about) to see the About page you just created.",

			"step5": "Great job! Since there are already two pages in the site, it's better to add a navbar.\bOpen the `shared.json` file in `contents` and modify the `navbar` property to look like this:\b<pre>\"navbar\": [\n    { \"label\": \"Home\", \"href\": \"/\" },\n    { \"label\": \"About\", \"href\": \"/about\" }\n]</pre>\bAlso, you can change the title of your site by changing the `site-title` property.\bReload the page, when you're done.",

			"step6": "Sweet! This site is coming up nicely. If you want to change the markup used for the site title and navbar, you can do it by editing `templates/_header.mustache`. Layout files, other than the `_layout.mustache`, that has a name starting with an underscore are known as partial layouts. You can include them in other layouts, using the following syntax - `{{> header }}`.\bAlso note, any property you define in `contents/shared.json` is made available to all pages of the site.\bNow let's go back to [homepage](/) and try to make it little prominent.",

			"step7": "So far we used the main layout (`templates/_layout.mustache`) to render all pages of the site. We shall create a separate layout for the homepage to make it more prominent.\bYou can create a new layout by simply copying the `_layout.mustache` into a new file. Save it as `index.mustache`.\bIf there's a layout by the name of a requested page, Punch will use that layout to render the page (eg. `index.mustache` will be picked to render `/index` request).\bThere are many interesting things you can try on homepage; but for now we'll just insert a banner image. Copy a suitable image into `templates` directory. Then, modify the markup of `index.mustache` to show the image:\b<pre>&lt;div role=\"main\"&gt;\n  &lt;img src=\"banner.jpg\"&gt;\n  {{{intro}}}\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre>Reload the page, when you're done.",

			"step8": "Woah! Look you just created a nice little site with Punch :)\bTo learn further on the concepts we touched upon and discover other great features in Punch, you can peruse [Punch Guide](https://github.com/laktek/punch/wiki).\bTo remove this block, go to `templates/_footer.mustache` and remove the tag `{{{first_run}}}`.\bHappy Hacking!",

			"skip": "To remove this block, go to `templates/_footer.mustache` and remove the tag `{{{first_run}}}`.\bBTW, [Punch Guide](https://github.com/laktek/punch/wiki) might come in handy, when you want to refer how to get certain things done.\bHappy Hacking!"
