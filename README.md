#Thought Piece: Violence of the New

###Introduction
This is another microsite for seymourpowell. The site is an article written by Richard Seymour, but is also a template for further thought pieces. The site is built such that it can easily be altered for a new article. I've used 'Mustache' so in the future, almost all content can easily be interchanged by simply changing a json file.
